### Dog breed classifier

ML project for learning to classify dog breeds.

### Project setup:
To activate the conda environment with the .yml file (that is hopefully updated and maintained as needed), please refer
to conda docs regarding this topic.

https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file

Tl;dr: `conda env create -f keras-dog-env.yml` and then `conda activate keras-dog`

### Sourcing data:
Model is trained using data set from "Stanford dogs dataset" which can be found at: http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/
